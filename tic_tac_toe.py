# Steps to complete the Tic Tac Toe Project
# Step 1 : Create a board using a 2-dimensional array and initialize each element as empty.

def print_header() -> None:
    print("Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe \n")











# Check for all the rows, columns, and two diagonals.


# p2 = Player("alvi", 'O')
# p3 = Player("sazaat", 'X')


# Step 5: Write a function to start the game.
# * elect the first turn of the player randomly.
# * Write an infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
# * Show the board to the user to select the spot for the next move.
# * Ask the user to enter the row and column number.
# * Update the spot with the respective player sign.
# * Check whether the current player won the game or not.
# * If the current player won the game, then print a winning message and break the infinite loop.
# * Next, check whether the board is filled or not.
# * If the board is filled, then print the draw message and break the infinite loop.
